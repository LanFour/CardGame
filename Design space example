two card games example for design space

lets say both have 4 mechanics
type, color, timing and effects

game 1 has respectively 2, 5, 2 and 500 variations of these mechanics
but 
game 2 has 10, 10, 10, and 10 variations,

if you multiply the combinations:
2 * 5 * 2 * 500 	= 10 000
10 * 10 * 10 * 10	= 10 000

The possible cards are the same for both,
but 
the mechanics the player has to memorize are 509 for game 1
and 40 for game 2, game 2 is easier to learn.
